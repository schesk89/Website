## Filtering Columns and Rows

Finding all the Yankees that hit greater than 40 homeruns we could write the following code


```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
query<-"SELECT playerID,teamID,yearID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE teamID='NYA' and HR>=40"

sqldf(query)
```


Suppose we wanted to find all the stances where a player had more than 40 homeruns but less than 60 strikeouts

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)

query<-"SELECT playerID,yearID,teamID,HR,SO FROM Batting
WHERE HR>40 and SO<60"

sqldf(query)

```
